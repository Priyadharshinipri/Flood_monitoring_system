Project Title: 

        IoT Flood Monitoring System



Overview:

Create a flood monitoring system that uses IoT technology to detect and monitor water levels in areas prone to flooding. This system will provide real-time data, alerts, and remote monitoring capabilities to help mitigate flood-related risks.



Components:



Water Level Sensors: 

      Use water level sensors like ultrasonic or pressure sensors to measure water levels at different locations.



Microcontrollers: 

       Employ microcontrollers (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi) to gather data from sensors and send it to a central control unit.



Central Control Unit: 

         This unit collects data from multiple sensors, processes it, and sends it to a cloud server or a local database.



Internet Connectivity: 

      Add a Wi-Fi or cellular module to the central control unit for internet connectivity.



Cloud Server: 

       If using the cloud, set up a cloud server (e.g., AWS, Azure) to store and manage data.



Mobile App/Web Interface: 

      Develop a user-friendly app or web interface to display real-time flood data and send alerts
